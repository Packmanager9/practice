    // In This lesson you will declare a variable and read the value you assign to it.
    // For example see the lines of code below
    let exampleVariable = 99;
    console.log(exampleVariable);
    // Let's look at what will happen here!

    
    // First, we say: let exampleVariable = 99;
    // using the word 'let' we are declaring something, we are saying 'let there be: ...' and then naming it, in this case 'exampleVariable'.
    // we are creating a 'token' that will store value, the token is the name of the variable, and it is it CaSe SeNsItIvE.
    // when we say " = 99; " we are then completing the statement, and assigning the value of the 'token' we have created, to be the number 99.

    // Second we say "console.log(exampleVariable);"
    // what we have done here is quite powerful, it is a nice short way to tell the computer to print out the value into the 'console'
    // the console in this context is a text based information source that can display details about a program or code being run.
    // the console is available in web browsers such as chrome, edge, firefox, and others by holding 'ctrl'+'shift'+'c' at the same time.
    // on a Mac, you will need to press 'command'+'shift'+'c' 
    // if the keys aren't working for you don't worry, right-clicking the page and then clicking 'inspect element' from the context menu that appears
    // once inside the inspector navigate from the elements tab to the 'console' tab.
    
  
      // TO DO:
    // Now, in the space below please create a variable that you name yourself, assign it a value, and tell the computer to print it out.
    let solutionVariable = 123;
    console.log(solutionVariable);
