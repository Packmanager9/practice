        // functions are helpful things that you can use, they can contain code and be made to do just about anything
        // this example adds two numbers together and 'returns' the answer
        // a return value is how you make a function 'give back' the answer

        // Here's an example of how you would 'call' a function. 
        // think of calling a function like calling someone to do a job for you, you call out the function's name, and you'll need the parentheses '()'
        // In this function, it will take two numbers, the order is the same as above, with 100 being the 'firstNumber' and 20 being the 'secondNumber'
        // we expect that the function will return the sum, and so we can assign a new variable to hold that sum.
         let output = addNumbersExample(100, 20)
        //remember console.log()? Review lesson one if you do not.
        console.log(output);

            //TO DO
        // In the Space below please create and name a function
