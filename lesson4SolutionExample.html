        // Objects are helpful types of data, or better, a way of storing data in an organized way that both the human and computer can easily understand.
        // There is a bit of compromise, for the computer to understand we use the dot '.' as a way to seperate the address of a part of the data
        // you may say I live in Washington, but you also live on Earth, and Earth lives in the Solar System. 
        // To a Computer you may say 'Universe.milkyWay.earth.USA.washington' and so on with a dot.
        let dummyObjectExample = {}  // this '{}' is how you declare an empty object in javascript
        dummyObjectExample.number = 10 // this line assigns an attribute called number, to the value 10
        dummyObjectExample.name = "Jam" // this line assigns an attribute called name, to the value "Jam""
        console.log(dummyObjectExample);  // this line logs the object

        // in the space below please construct an object and give it five attributes with values and log it to the console
